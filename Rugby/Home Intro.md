# Home Intro

Hi xxxxxxx

I'm one of the coaches for Wirral U10s and I think you're heading to ours next.
I've put the fixture out, and usually we have 18 to 22, enough for two teams and a few subs.

Can you let me know how many kids you'll be bringing by Wednesday, so I can get their meals booked, please?

We usually aim to kick off at 10:00/10:30 but I'll confirm the specifics when I get the pitch allocations from the club. 

We'll be looking to take it easy on the rucking side of things & go slowly for the kids, taking time on this and scrums as it’s still new and they're not 100% there yet.

Looking forward to it.
Chris
