# Away Intro

Hi xxxxxx

I'm one of the coaches for Wirral U10s and I think we're heading to yours next.

I've put the fixture out, and usually by Wednesday we take a cut on numbers, but it is usually 18 to 22, enough for two teams and a few subs. Our kids are fine with uncontested scrums and our rucks are pretty much there (when they remember!) and we're now focusing on ripping in the tackle
Once you know the times, pitch allocations etc, drop me a note and I'll update our group of parents & players.
Looking forward to it.
Chris
