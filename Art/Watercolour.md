# Watercolour

###### MidJourney

The watercolour painting of the Liverpool skyline at dusk on a white background is a serene and evocative composition. The gentle hues of the setting sun blend seamlessly into the sky, with shades of soft pinks, purples, and oranges reflecting on the calm waters of the River Mersey. The iconic buildings, including the Liver Building with its distinctive clock towers, stand silhouetted against the colourful twilight, their dark forms contrasted beautifully against the vibrant sky. Delicate brushstrokes capture the subtle details of the architecture, while the water below mirrors the fading light, creating a harmonious balance between the cityscape and the natural elements. The white background frames the scene, drawing the viewer's focus to the tranquil yet dynamic interplay of light and shadow, colour and silhouette, evoking a sense of calm and quiet beauty. --v 6 --ar 3:2
