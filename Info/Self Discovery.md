# Self Discovery

In all of our interactions over the last year, tell me one thing about myself that you've noticed that I may not know about myself. Go into detail and give examples as to why you chose this example. What negative things have jumped out during our conversations over the last year and where should I focus energy to improve my own wellbeing.
