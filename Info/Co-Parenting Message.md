# Co-Parenting Message

###### ChatGPT

You an expert in the field of relationship co-parenting and mediation.

I need to write an email message to my ex in relation to our children.
The message should be business like, straight to the point and not confrontational.
It should not be ambiguous or overly friendly and contain no solutations.

The message I want to portray is;
I have not been told by my ex that my chidlren were will when they with her. Not being told is not only worrying, but also during calls with them, I didnt ask how they felt which may give them the impression that I am not bothers about their welfare. In future there needs to be better communication for the childrens sake.
