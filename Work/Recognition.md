# Recognition

I want you to write a short paragraph I can use to recognise my appreciation of work carried out by a colleague, and suggest which category it fits best;

The categories are;
- World Class Service for customers and clients every time
- Precision in our operations, our rick management, and our controls
- Focus on businesses and projects where we excel
- Simplicity and efficiency, seeking out every opportunity to automate
- Diversity of thought championing new thinking and challenging the status quo

The person being recognised is: xxxxx

What they did: xxxxx

The tone should be friendly, trustworthy, and informal. The recognition should not use any professional or corporate lingo.

Write it in 3rd person.
