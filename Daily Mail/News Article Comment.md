It should;
- be crude
- contain sexual innuendos

- ridicule the people mentioned in the article.
- Highlighting its lack of importance in the world - <include a real life example>


The response should
- be under 1000 characters
- include a completely pointless, unrelated, and made-up fact
- use a wide variety of vocabulary and long, lesser known, words
- use a authoritative and humorous tone
