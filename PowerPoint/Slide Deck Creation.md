###### ChatGPT

As an expert in the field of "mens mental health and wellbeing" I want you to write me VBA code for a PowerPoint about "International Mens Day 2024". It should have a bias towards mental health rather than physical health and read in an informative, trustworthy, light and friendly tone. It should cover topics and questions such as; 
- give a background to what IMD is and why it is important
- should be focused on UK statistics
- contain facts and figures from recent research (always quote source of information)
- explain how things have changed over the past 10 years 
- highlight areas that still need to be advanced to change stigma
- a slide touching on my own mental health struggles and the learning I have done
- links to Zero Suicide Alliance, Calm, Mind, Samaritans etc and other UK based initiatives

Each slide with bullet points should have a minimum of 5

You are to fill in the text with your own knowledge.
You should include comprehensive bullet pointed speaker notes that discuss the information shown in the slide whilst calling out key facts and information.
No placed holders.
I need 10 slides.
