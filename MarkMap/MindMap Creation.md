# Mental Health MindMap Creation

###### ChatGPT

Generate a complete Markdown MindMap about the top 10 most common mental health disorders in the UK, organised by each disorder.

For each disorder, include the following branches:

- Triggers or Potential Causes: Provide specific examples, including biological, environmental, and situational triggers where relevant.
- External Signs to Others: List observable signs such as behavioural, social, and physical symptoms, with several examples under each.
- Impact to the Person Affected: Describe the emotional, social, and physical impact on the person. Include examples where relevant.
- Facts: Provide three facts based on UK statistics or research, and include the source link for each.
- Self Help: List practical self-help techniques for managing symptoms, such as daily practices, lifestyle changes, or mindfulness techniques.
- Support Channels Available: Include two branches here:
- Therapies: List specific therapies relevant to each disorder (such as CBT, DBT, CFT, CAT), and link to UK-based resources or explanations for each therapy.
- Support Organisations: Include UK-based organisations with links to their websites.

The MindMap should be detailed, with each example on its own line under each bullet point (instead of in a list separated by commas).
Structure the content in a way that could be directly copied into a Markdown editor for easy reading and formatting, and ensure that the response is comprehensive, professional, and focused on UK-specific information.
