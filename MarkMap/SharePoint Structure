As a season website developer, I want you to write Markdown code for a MindMap helping develop a Sharepoint website structure. The website is aimed at a Single Parents ERG and should cover some of the following areas;
- Internal Support (what is available in work, HR policies, ERGs, Private Medical etc)
- External Support (government support such as child care, reduced housing tax, Legal Support such as free advice, Support organisations)
- Resouces (books, podcasts, links)
- Finances & Budgeting
